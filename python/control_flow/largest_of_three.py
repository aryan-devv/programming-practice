# Largest of Three Numbers
# This program takes three numbers as input
# and prints the largest among them using comparisons

# Take input from the user
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
c = int(input("Enter third number: "))

# Check which number is the largest
if a >= b and a >= c:
    print("Largest number is:", a)
elif b >= a and b >= c:
    print("Largest number is:", b)
else:
    print("Largest number is:", c)

# Output:
# Enter first number: 6
# Enter second number: 7
# Enter third number: 9
